This workshop session presents research findings related to the identification of students who are at risk of reading difficulties. The participants will participate in the discussion of topics related to how some students could be struggling to read Thai language; the nature of Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD); curriculum-based assessment; and teaching and intervention strategies for students with SLD in the context of Thai classrooms.
