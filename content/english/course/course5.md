Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic propelled university administrators and
teachers to look to all kinds of educational technologies for remedies, often without even first
understanding the basic problems in education. As the pandemic subsides, teachers are then
expected to return to their old way of life—abandon those technologies altogether. This matter
is perplexing, and far from trivial. In this session, we will return to examine what fundamentally
constitutes good education at the university. Together, we will review and address the
associated problems at both scientific and policy levels.
